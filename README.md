A film review Single Page Application build in React.

To do: 

* Make a more robust rate throttling system to avoid hitting the rate limit cap. 
* Set up a way to store requests that can't be requested due to throttling the requests.
* Make all the filters work.
* Get the genres and languages from the API instead of having them hard coded.
* Better error handling if the API requests fail.
